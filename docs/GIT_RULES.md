# Git rules

How a change travels from a developer's machine to a release. The reasons behind
each rule are in the ADRs linked below; this page is the checklist.

## Branches

| Branch | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `dev` | Default branch. Every pull request targets it. |
| `main` | Released code. Only receives the promotion pull request from `dev` and the release pull request from release-please. |
| `feature/…`, `fix/…`, `chore/…`, `docs/…` | Working branches, created from `dev`. The prefix is a convention, not enforced. |

Never push directly to `dev` or `main`: both are protected.

```text
feature/xxx --merge commit--> dev --merge commit--> main --> tag + CHANGELOG
                               ^                      |
                               +----- back-merge -----+
```

## Merging

- **Merge commit only**, on `dev` and on `main`. No squash, no rebase merge
  — same rule as the backend template (ADR-0002 there). Every
  commit keeps its author and its own line in the history.
- Enforced by a ruleset on both branches, as in the backend template (ADR-0007
  there).
- To update a branch with the latest `dev`, prefer `git pull --rebase origin dev`.
  A merge from `dev` is accepted, but it adds noise to the history.
- After a release, `main` is merged back into `dev` automatically
  (`.github/workflows/back-merge.yml`).

## Commit messages

[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org), because every commit
reaches `main` and release-please builds the changelog and the version from them.

```text
<type>(<optional scope>)<optional !>: <subject>
```

| Type | Changelog | Version |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `feat` | Added | minor |
| `fix` | Fixed | patch |
| `perf` | Performance | patch |
| `refactor` | Changed | patch |
| `revert` | Reverted | patch |
| `docs`, `test`, `chore`, `ci`, `build`, `style` | hidden | none |

A `!` after the type, or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer, is a breaking change: major
bump. Hidden types alone never trigger a release.

- Header at most 100 characters. Scope free. Subject case free.
- Messages written by git itself (`Merge …`, `Revert "…"`, `fixup! …`) are not
  checked.

Examples: `feat(season): show the live leaderboard`, `fix: reject empty names`,
`build(deps): bump nuxt`.

## Local hooks

Installed by `npm install` (the `prepare` script runs husky). Nothing else to do.

| Hook | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `pre-commit` | lint-staged: `oxlint --fix` then `prettier --write` on staged files, re-staged automatically. |
| `commit-msg` | commitlint, same rules as CI (`.commitlintrc.json`). |

Hooks can be skipped with `--no-verify`. CI runs the same checks and cannot be.

## Linters and formatter

| Tool | Where | Covers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| oxlint | pre-commit (staged files), CI with `--type-aware` | JavaScript / TypeScript, script blocks of `.vue` files |
| ESLint | CI, `npm run lint` | Vue templates and accessibility (ADR-FE-015). Rules already covered by oxlint are turned off by `eslint-plugin-oxlint`. |
| Prettier | pre-commit, CI `--check` | Formatting, config in `.prettierrc.json` |

oxlint cannot replace ESLint yet: its JS plugins do not support custom parsers,
so `eslint-plugin-vuejs-accessibility` would see no template.

The commit that applied the Prettier config to the whole repository is listed in
`.git-blame-ignore-revs`, which GitHub reads on its own. Locally:
`git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs`.

## Pull request checks

| Check | Required |
| --- | --- |
| `Lint / oxlint` | yes |
| `Lint / eslint` | yes |
| `Lint / prettier` | yes |
| `Lint / typecheck` | yes |
| `Test / vitest` | yes |
| `Build / nuxt build` | yes |
| `Commitlint` | yes |
| `Trivy Security Scan` | yes (reports, never fails) |
| `GitHub Actions audit` (zizmor) | yes |
| `E2E / cypress` | **no**, for now: the suite still has to prove it is stable |
| `Lighthouse / lighthouse` | **no**, scores vary between runners (ADR-FE-014) |
| `SonarQube Cloud scan` | **no**, skipped on Dependabot pull requests |

`dev` requires branches to be up to date before merging.

## Releases

1. Open a pull request from `dev` to `main`, merge it with a merge commit.
2. release-please opens or updates `chore(main): release X.Y.Z` on `main`.
3. Merging it writes `CHANGELOG.md`, bumps `package.json` and tags `vX.Y.Z`.
4. The back-merge workflow merges `main` into `dev`.
